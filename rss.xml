            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How I hacked my way to land a job.</h1><h2>Self-awareness</h2><p>Before I tell you the story about how I got myself a job at iflix, let me give you a brief introduction of myself. My name is Akanshu from India with a degree in hospitality from Switzerland. My hobbies include travelling and I have always nursed a dream. My dream was to own a restaurant where I will serve my customers the tastiest meals in a very lovely environment and hence my reason for studying hospitality. In fact I went ahead to work as an intern in restaurants and hotels but I lost my passion for this, as I felt that the industry was slow and wasnâ€™t as engaging as I first thought.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c237cc15648d85b2006e6035ebfe9b02/croprotate.png?cropheight=1828&cropwidth=799&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fed1d9965-eec8-4690-a04b-ef4826cda109.png&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
